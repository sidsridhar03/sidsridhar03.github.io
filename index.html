    <h1><b>Post-surgery breathing exercise management for patients and healthcare providers</b></h1>
    <p>Current therapeutic spirometry used after all inpatient surgeries relies on outdated mechanical devices, patient self-administration and reporting, and nursing-intensive bedside monitoring.</p>

    <h2><b>We enable better therapeutic spirometry administration, monitoring, and outcomes for:</b></h2>
    <h3>patients</h3>
    <p>to get immediate feedback and guidance on when and how to do their post-surgery therapeutic spirometry.</p> 
    <h3>loved ones</h3>
    <p>to check in and provide encouragement and support on their patient’s lung rehabilitation progress.</p> 
    <h3>nurses</h3>
    <p>to easily view accurate, reliable patient inhalation volume progress and adherence to administer appropriate care for patients that are non-adherent or showing concerning volume trends.</p> 
    <h3>nurse managers</h3>
    <p>and respiratory therapists to better allocate bedside care resources for better patient outcomes.</p> 
    <h3>surgeons</h3>
    <p>to get reliable, quantitative support for earlier discharge or earlier interventions of complications both in the hospital and at home.</p> 
    <h3>and hospitals systems</h3>
    <p>to decrease risk of postoperative lung complication incidence for reduced non-reimbursed treatment costs and better bed turnover.</p>

    <h2>What we hear people ask about therapeutic spirometry…</h2>
    <h3><b>What puts someone at risk for lung complications?</b></h3>
    <p>Whether a patient received a lung transplant, hip replacement, colorectal resection, or spinal fusion, their lungs will be at risk from being on anesthesia and inactivity in the hospital bed. Depending on the indication, up to ~40% of patients experience breathing issues after surgery, leading to complications like pneumonia and the need for even more medical intervention. These complications cause significant harm to patients, increase hospital stays, and make healthcare much more expensive.</p>
    <h3><b>What does therapeutic spirometry do?</b></h3>
    <p>Therapeutic spirometry (also called "incentive spirometer") is an important part of care for encouraging lung health after inpatient surgeries. When patients are stationary and were on anesthesia in the hospital, they are prone to taking shallow breaths. This can lead to a condition called atelectasis where the lungs can deflate, which lead to complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and more.<br>Therapeutic spirometry reduces the likelihood of these complications by encouraging deep breaths that re-inflate alveoli. Patients are to take breaths with the spirometer every 10 minutes, during which they try to reach a target inhale volume set by a nurse.</p>
    <h3><b>Why may therapeutic spirometry “not work”?</b></h3>
    <p>WTherapeutic spirometry suffers from low patient adherence, which make its effects limited in practice. Current therapeutic spirometers also make it very difficult to track adherence. <br> There are many reasons patients don't use their therapeutic spirometers: pain, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of motivation. Many patients also struggle to complete the exercises correctly without any help from a care provider. Between patients completing exercises incorrectly or forgetting to complete them at all, these limitations lead to preventable, post-operative pulmonary complications. </p>
    <h3><b>What's the difference between Airalux® and other spirometers like Aluna or Spirolink?</b></h3>
    <p>Digital spirometers currently on the market are mostly diagnostic spirometers, not therapeutic spirometers. They focus on exhaled lung measurements that can help clinicians flag and diagnose lung conditions, but do not offer exercises that focus on inpatient post-surgery deep breathing. We offer features specifically targeted to breathing exercises after surgery while patients are still at the hospital that reduce the risk of post-surgery lung complications that incur treatment costs not covered by insurance reimbursements.</p>
