    <h1><b>Post-surgery breathing exercise management for patients and healthcare providers</b></h1>
    <p>Current therapeutic spirometry used after all inpatient surgeries relies on outdated mechanical devices, patient self-administration and reporting, and nursing-intensive bedside monitoring.</p>

    <h2><b>We enable better therapeutic spirometry administration, monitoring, and outcomes for:</b></h2>
    <h3>patients</h3>
    <p>to get immediate feedback and guidance on when and how to do their post-surgery therapeutic spirometry.</p> 
    <h3>loved ones</h3>
    <p>to check in and provide encouragement and support on their patientâ€™s lung rehabilitation progress.</p> 
    <h3>nurses</h3>
    <p>to easily view accurate, reliable patient inhalation volume progress and adherence to administer appropriate care for patients that are non-adherent or showing concerning volume trends.</p> 
    <h3>nurse managers</h3>
    <p>and respiratory therapists to better allocate bedside care resources for better patient outcomes.</p> 
    <h3>surgeons</h3>
    <p>to get reliable, quantitative support for earlier discharge or earlier interventions of complications both in the hospital and at home.</p> 
    <h3>and hospitals systems</h3>
    <p>to decrease risk of postoperative lung complication incidence for reduced non-reimbursed treatment costs and better bed turnover.</p>
